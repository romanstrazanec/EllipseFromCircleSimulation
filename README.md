# Ellipse from Circle

![Start position](img/start.jpg)

Define a circle, an eccentric point inside the circle and line segments starting from the point and ending at the circle's circumference.

Rotating every line around its mid-point by 90 degrees creates an ellipse with the center of the circle and the point as its focal points.

## Instructions

To run the simulation *[Processing](https://processing.org/)* needs to be installed.
After installation open *EllipseFromCircle.pde* and run.
While running, pressing the mouse button sets new point from which the lines are going to be created.
