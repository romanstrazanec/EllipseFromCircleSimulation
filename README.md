# Ellipse from Circle

![Start position](img/start.jpg)

Define a circle, an eccentric point inside the circle and line segments starting from the point and ending at the circle's circumference.

Rotating every line around its mid-point by 90 degrees creates an ellipse with the center of the circle and the point as its focal points.
